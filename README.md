## Description

My project is a personal rendition of PingPong. It was the first game I have ever played so it holds a special place inside my heart. It was something that I considered fun and addictiong so iwanted to be able to implement my own twist to the game thanks to my professor's TA. I was given a few challenges which were adding a background image, sprites for the paddles, and making the ball change color when it hits the paddles. I am proud to be able to accomplish two out of three which were adding a background image and making the ball change color when it hits the paddles. It means more to me that I was able to make something for myself and I enjoyed this final project.

The src file contains a copyright free jpg from a website called Pexels and my python code called Project.py. Proposal.md is documentation of what I will be doing for the final project involving description, features, challenges, outcomes, and milestones. my readme.md file containd my final description of my code, demo video, and github repository. Requirements.txt as all of the 3rd party libraries that my project requires.

I don't think there are any design considerations. Future areas of improvement would be being able to use sprite for the paddles and to over all advance the game and implementing new game modes for future creations.I also wouldn't mind adding onto this project after this semester ends like maybe creating a score and game over display.

# PING THE PONG!


## Repository
https://github.com/abbyytorres/Final_Project.git


## Description
It will become a game that we all know and enjoy which is ping pong! 
It is relevent to media because it was one of the first games that introdused me to digital media and arts.  


## Features
- Player can move the paddles
	- I will be importing pygame and sys to implement the movement to keys on a keyboard.

- I will make the ping pong ball move 
	- I will try to generate a code where the pingpong ball moved from contact with the paddles.


## Challenges
- I would need to learn a little bit more about sys and how to use it for my code.
- I will need to learn a few more of the .draw code from pygame for this code.
- I will need to learn how to work on my project alone.


## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- My ideal out come is for my code to run a pingpong game. 
I hope that my code launches right to show the viewer 2 rectangular ping pong paddles and a ball.
Finally, I hope it is executes the keys to play correctly.


Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare essentials for a good working outcome would be that the ball and rectangular paddles are seen in the window.
Another essential would be that the keys connected to to the paddles work to create movement.


## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. I learn how sys works in python.
  2. I use pygame and sys correctly on the code.

- Week 2
  1. I execute the keys (keyboard keys) to the correct paddle.
  2. I create movement for the pingpong ball.

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. I finish the code.
  2. The code is executed correctly.
